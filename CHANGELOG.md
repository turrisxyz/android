   navigate or refresh in the ownCloud app, it synchronizes automatically, keeping consistence
   of your files.

   https://github.com/owncloud/android/issues/3475
   https://github.com/owncloud/android/pull/3499

   https://github.com/owncloud/android/pull/3431

* Bugfix - Logging does not stop when the user deactivates it: [#3436](https://github.com/owncloud/android/pull/3436)

   Previously, when users disabled the logging option in the settings, the application would not
   stop logging and the size of the log files would increase. Now, the option to disable it works
   perfectly and no logs are collected if disabled.

   https://github.com/owncloud/android/issues/3325
   https://github.com/owncloud/android/pull/3436

* Enhancement - Delete old user directories in order to free memory: [#3336](https://github.com/owncloud/android/pull/3336)

   Previously, when users deleted an account the synchronized files of this account stayed on the
   SD-Card. So if the user didn't want them anymore he had to delete them manually. Now, the app
   automatically removes the files associated with an account.

   https://github.com/owncloud/android/issues/125
   https://github.com/owncloud/android/pull/3336

* Enhancement - Delete old logs every week: [#3328](https://github.com/owncloud/android/issues/3328)

   https://github.com/owncloud/android/pull/3385

* Enhancement - Scoped Storage: [#2877](https://github.com/owncloud/android/issues/2877)

   The way to store files in the device has changed completely. Previously, the files were stored
   in the shared storage. That means that apps that had access to the shared storage, could read,
   write or do whatever they wanted with the ownCloud files.

   Now, ownCloud files are stored in the Scoped Storage, so they are safer. Other apps can access
   ownCloud files using the Documents Provider, which is the native way to do it, and that means
   that the ownCloud app has full control of its files.

   Furthermore, if the app is removed, the files downloaded to ownCloud are removed too. So, files
   are not lost or forgotten in the device after uninstalling the app.

   https://github.com/owncloud/android/issues/2877

   only shown if the device has the suitable hardware for it.

   Settings have been updated to use the current Android's recommendation, AndroidX framework.
   In addition, they have been reorganized into subsections for a better understanding and
   navigation structure. Also, new features have been added: now, source path and behaviour in
   auto uploads can be chosen differently for pictures and videos.

* Enhancement - Settings accessible even when no account is attached: [#2638](https://github.com/owncloud/android/issues/2638)

   Now, settings can be accessed via a button in the login screen, removing the necessity to have an
   attached account. However, auto picture and video uploads won't be available until an account
   is registered in the app.

   https://github.com/owncloud/android/issues/2638
   https://github.com/owncloud/android/pull/3218

* Enhancement - Fixed account for camera uploads: [#3166](https://github.com/owncloud/android/issues/3166)
